# This is a small tetris game that I wrote it React

## At the moment all the major features are there, but there are some bugs
  - There is no end or start condition, refreshing the games starts a new game
    - Add game to local storage
    - Add start and restart game
    - There is no point count
  - Add ghost to show where the tetromino will land
  - I would like to do lots of refactoring, I rushed this.
