# This is a small tetris game that I wrote it React

## At the moment all the major features are there, but there are some bugs
  - Side collisions are not working correctly
  - When holding the down arrow sometimes the tetromino will go below the last line
  - There is no end or start condition, refreshing the games starts a new game
    - Add game to local storage
    - Add start and restart game
  - The functionality to remove completed lines is very broken.
    - Only a single line disappear when multiple lines should
    - The inactive blocks will only move down one block when they should move multiple
  - Add ghost to show where the tetromino will land
